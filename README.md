## Lipases / Acyltransferases

Overview
Welcome to the Fantastic Enzymes project repository, where we combine biotechnology and artificial intelligence (AI) to develop sustainable bio-based alternatives to traditional petrochemical products. This research focuses on enzyme selection and engineering to facilitate eco-friendly biochemical reactions, with a particular emphasis on the esterification of polyphenols.

Our primary goal is to leverage cutting-edge AI tools like AlphaFold and RosettaFold for enzyme structure prediction and molecular docking simulations to identify optimal lipases and acyltransferases. These enzymes will catalyze the esterification of polyphenols in a water-based system, driving key reactions crucial for developing sustainable bio-based products with applications in industries such as food, biomaterials, cosmetics, and biofuels. The integration of computational predictions with experimental validation will lead to breakthroughs in sustainable bioeconomy technologies.
